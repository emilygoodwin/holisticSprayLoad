# Overview
This repository contains the code for the experiments reported in 

[Production of syntactic alternations displays accessibility but not informativity effects](https://alpslab.stanford.edu/papers/2024GoodwinDegen.pdf). Goodwin, E. and Degen, J. (2024). In Proceedings of the 46th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society.

## General information

- Experiment 1: Non-interactive picture description task. Effect of foregrounding on spray-load productions, without informativity manipulation. 
- Experiment 1 Norming: Norming stimuli for affectedness
- Experiment 2: Interactive picture description task (participnats in dyads). Effect of informativity and foregrounding on spray-load productions.
